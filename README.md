# Age-in-Days



This App needs just your year of birth: for instance you're born 2020, you just enter 2020 and the App will count the days you live. Remember the count is just keeping track of your birth year not the month or the actual day that you're born. For example someone pass in his/her born year as 2019 the answer will be 360 days old even you're born in December 2019.
